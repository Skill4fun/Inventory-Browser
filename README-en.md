<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

The app is designed to display the current inventory of an international consumer electronics and computer accessories manufacturer in a browsable, user-friendly manner and generate useful, exportable reports for a variety of purposes.

The initial raw data the App uses is provided by the factory's hourly updated XML data-feed for approximately 3,000 unique products.

## Target areas of use, functions:

### Sales

_Useful tool in the field:_
>
>The App helps to present the factory's assortment transparently during negotiations. We can display the product portfolio quickly and simply, filter it by category or search among products by other criteria.
It provides information about current stocks, prices, as well as photos and other specs of each product.

_Support in other sales activities:_
>
>It simplifies the compilation of different custom quotes as you can browse between products and find all relevant data in one place.
In the future, it will be possible to compile and export Special Offers/quotations, downloadable in excel/pdf format

### Business Development

>The App provides features where you display various long-term statistical analyzes / statements / charts to help us keep track of current market trends and needs. Based on these, our business strategy can be more accurate and effective.
>
>It helps to determine the right pricing policy and future product developments (supply expansion, product delisting) aiming the best possible rate of return and the lowest possible risk.
